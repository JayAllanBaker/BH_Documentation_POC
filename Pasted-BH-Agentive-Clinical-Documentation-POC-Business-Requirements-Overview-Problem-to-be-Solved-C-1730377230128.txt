BH – Agentive Clinical Documentation POC
Business Requirements
Overview
Problem to be Solved: 
Current Behavioral Health and Medical treatment plans often lack personalization, leading to low adherence rates and reduced treatment effectiveness. Additionally, healthcare providers are burdened with extensive documentation requirements, which detract from their ability to focus on face-to-face interactions with patients. This administrative overload compromises both provider efficiency and effectiveness.
Incomplete or inaccurate documentation can also result in non-compliance with MEAT (Monitor, Evaluate, Assess, Treat) and TAMPER (Time, Action, Medical Necessity, Plan, Education, Response) documentation requirements, posing legal and regulatory risks. There is a critical need for a solution that allows providers to concentrate on patient care during visits while ensuring that complete and personalized documentation is generated automatically.
An AI-powered system that accurately interprets patient visits, complies with MEAT and TAMPER documentation standards, and dynamically adjusts to a patient's medical history and responses can address these challenges. By automating documentation tasks and providing personalized care recommendations, such a solution can significantly improve treatment outcomes, enhance provider efficiency, and ensure compliance with essential documentation requirements.
Solution Overview: 
This Proof of Concept (POC) aims to create an AI-powered system that generates personalized treatment documentation and recommendations in real time, based on a patient’s medical history, current health data, and feedback. This adaptive approach can improve the quality and precision of healthcare delivery, benefiting both patients and providers.
Users Involved:
•	Patients: Receiving personalized treatment plans.
•	Healthcare Providers: Inputting patient data and utilizing insights for optimized care.
•	Clinics and Health Organizations: Integrating the AI system with existing Electronic Health Records (EHR) to improve patient treatment processes.
Inputs, Process, and Outputs:
•	Inputs: Data such as patient demographics, medical history, ongoing treatments, current symptoms, and patient responses is collected via desktop or mobile interfaces. This data includes audio, video, images, and text inputs.
•	Process: The system processes patient data through several integrated agents: transcription, data management, and documentation agents. Each agent has specific roles, from converting audio to text to integrating information into a centralized database.
•	Outputs: The final output consists of personalized treatment recommendations delivered through desktop, mobile, or Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems for the end users—patients and healthcare providers.
